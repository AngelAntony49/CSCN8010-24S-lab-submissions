## Lab 5 - Cross-Validation for Model Selection

### Submission Process Note

1. When you push your solution to GitHub, it will be included as part of the pull request (PR) for Lab 4.
2. This is expected and perfectly fine. The PR should encompass both Lab 4 and Lab 5.
3. Both labs will be evaluated together, with a total of 6 points allocated for each HTML file.
4. **There are no changes to the regular submission process. Simply push your changes to GitHub as usual.**
5. **Once the HTML file for Lab 5 is ready, add it to the description of the existing pull request (PR) that includes Lab 4.**
5. **Please ensure that the link to Lab 4 is also retained in the PR description.**

Please adhere to the submission guidelines outlined above to ensure a smooth evaluation process for your labs. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out for assistance.

### Task

1. Utilize the diabetes dataset from lab 4. Perform cross-validation on nine polynomial models, ranging from degree 0 to 8. (2 points)
2. Construct a table summarizing the cross-validation results. Each model should have a separate row in the table. Include the R-Squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics for each model. Calculate the mean value and standard deviation of these metrics from the cross-validation. Include both values. (2 points)
3. Identification of the Best Model: Identify the model that exhibits the highest performance based on the R-Squared and MAE metrics. Provide an explanation for choosing this specific model. (2 points)

Optional (No Extra Grade):Additional analysis and interpretation of the models' performances are welcome. You may explore further insights beyond the required metrics. Feel free to include your findings.
